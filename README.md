# 19CSE111

Hi, I am Praveen Perumal, In this repository I have implemented the data structures taught in the course 19CSE111 (Fundamentals of Data Structures) with C programming language.

## Data Structures Implemented

- [x] Stack (using array and linked list)
- [x] Queue (using array and linked list)
- [x] HashMap (using chaining for hash collision)
